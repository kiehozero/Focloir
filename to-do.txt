2. Reviews: Remove photo, change from card reveal to standard card with all content
3. Contact modal - emailJS edits
4. Text size on scores for larger screens
5. Edit profile page, allow user to change account details or delete altogether - password not working. Just need to modify

6. Need a page to redirect to if a user, whether logged in or out tries to manually type the URL for another user's profile, 
if session.user does not equal user_id being passed in route?
7. Add pub form: Validation (see point below as well needs to be strong enough to eliminate reviews that are just all spaces 
(see emailJS form on MS2 as this was validated this way)
8. Add review: validation on form currently allows submission all of spaces in textarea, no value selected on 
rating, price can be zero, price box doesn't tell user the format that needs to be submitted if they do it incorrectly, remove 
pint dropdown
