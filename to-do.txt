1. Need a page to redirect to if a user, whether logged in or out tries to manually type the URL for another user's profile, 
if session.user does not equal user_id being passed in route? Working for logged in users, not for logged out, also needs to
cover all URLs that a user can't access or that are invalid

4. Edit profile page, allow user to change account details or delete altogether - password not working. Just need to modify
the update function in pymongo to only update a particular field
5. Add pub form: Validation, see point below as well needs to be strong enough to eliminate addresses that are just all spaces 
(see emailJS CI tutorial?)
6. Add review: validation on form currently allows submission all of spaces in textarea, price box doesn't 
tell user the format that needs to be submitted if they do it incorrectly

Questions
- cloning in Heroku and Mongo, is this even possible?
