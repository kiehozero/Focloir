1. Reviews: Change photo to pub.photo (just pass pub db in route?) on my profile section, leave pub profile as is, change from 
card reveal to standard card with all content
2. Contact modal - emailJS edits
3. Need a page to redirect to if a user, whether logged in or out tries to manually type the URL for another user's profile, 
if session.user does not equal user_id being passed in route? Working for logged in users, not for logged out
4. Edit profile page, allow user to change account details or delete altogether - password not working. Just need to modify
the update function in pymongo to only update a particular field
5. Add pub form: Validation, see point below as well needs to be strong enough to eliminate reviews that are just all spaces 
(see emailJS CI tutorial?)
6. Add review: validation on form currently allows submission all of spaces in textarea, rice box doesn't 
tell user the format that needs to be submitted if they do it incorrectly
7. Video recordings of tests? One for register > login > add review > edit review > delete review, then an admin one for locate
user review > amend review > delete review > delete user
8. Moderate user page from Users page, functionality

Cleaning
- aria-labels on buttons with icons?

Questions
- cloning in Heroku and Mongo, is this even possible?
- got the session user working if one logged in user tries to access another profile, but it still returns a Jinja error if a logged
out user attempts the same thing
- need confirmation messages on delete review/user/pub buttons
